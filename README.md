# Woodhull Sentinel Digital Newspaper Archive Website 

The Town of Woodhull in Steuben County New York owns a physical collection of newspapers digitized by Backstage Library Works in Bethlehem PA in 2025. This repository contains code for a static website providing basic search, browse, and page views of the digitized collection. This website serves as a community-owned access point to our digitized newspaper archive, providing our community free, independent access to their historical record. 

To keep this website financially sustainable with very limited resources, we have focused on core capabilities: search, browse, view, zoom, and download. For most research needs, the following services will offer a better experience with superior search tools, enhanced viewing features, and easier navigation, and we encourage their use as the primary access method:

- [NYS Historic Newspapers](http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org). (**Free.**)
- [Fultonhistory.com](http://www.fultonhistory.com). (**Free.**)
- [Newspapers.com](http://www.newspapers.com). **(Paid subscription required.)**
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). (**Free.**)

Our website exists as a long-term baseline, controlled by our community and freely available to all. This ensures these historical materials remain accessible regardless of changes in external platforms or business models.
