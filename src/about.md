## About The Archive

This archive contains {{ metadata.totalPages }} digitized newspaper pages from {{ metadata.totalIssues }} issues, spanning {{ metadata.dateRange }}, comprised mostly of **The Woodhull Sentinel**, including its very first issue on June 5, 1930, which promised a "bang-up good paper" to serve the "folks of Woodhull, Jasper and the vicinity".

Each issue features comprehensive original reporting of community happenings, local government, schools, businesses, and civic affairs, complemented by broader coverage of state and federal politics, economic trends, and major world events. Each includes editorials and opinion pieces, as well as articles, reviews and regular columns on a range of topics, including politics, health, education, law and order, business, sports, entertainment and lifestyle. 

**The Town of Woodhull New York** owns the physical newspapers that were digitized by Backstage Library Works in Bethlehem PA in 2025 and made available for free on this site and through these other services:

### Our Mission

This website serves as a community-owned access point to our digitized newspaper archive, providing our community free, independent access to their historical record. 

To keep this website financially sustainable with very limited resources, we have focused on core capabilities: search, browse, view, zoom, and download. For most research needs, the larger external services will offer a better experience with superior search tools, enhanced viewing features, and easier navigation, and we encourage their use as the primary access method. 

This website exists as a long-term baseline, controlled by our community and freely available to all. This ensures these historical materials remain accessible regardless of changes in external platforms or business models.
